# Emergent In-Context Learning in Transformers

This is the codebase associated with the following paper:

**Data Distributional Properties Drive Emergent In-Context Learning in
Transformers** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05055))<br/>
_Stephanie C.Y. Chan, Adam Santoro, Andrew K. Lampinen, Jane X. Wang, Aaditya
Singh, Pierre H. Richemond, Jay McClelland, Felix Hill_

The experiments involve training and evaluating a transformer on sequences of
[Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) image-label pairs, to elicit
and measure (few-shot) in-context learning vs in-weights learning. See Sec 2 of
the paper for an overview of the experimental design.


## Installation

To install the necessary requirements:

```shell
python3 -m venv eicl_venv
source eicl_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ./emergent_in_context_learning/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Default configs

Default experiment configurations are provided in `configs/`, and can be used
in `$PATH_TO_CONFIG` in the launch commands below.

*   `images_all_exemplars.py`: Each character class consists of 20 image
    examples (the original Omniglot problem).
*   `images_augmented.py`: We augment the total number of classes to 8x the
    original number, by applying transformations to each image class: flip left
    or right + rotate 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
*   `images_identical.py`: Each character class consists only of a single image
    (the 1st of the 20 examples provided in the original Omniglot dataset)
*   `symbolic.py`: (relatively untested; not used in the paper)

Config files can be edited or forked as desired.

### Varieties of data sequences + Configurations for each

Omniglot sequences are generated in `datasets/data_generators.py`.

The image classes are divided into training and holdout. Training classes can be
"common" or "rare". The training classes can be uniformly or Zipf-distributed
(jointly over both common and rare classes). Related configurations are set in
`config.data.generator_config`.

There are few different types of data sequences:

*   `bursty` : These are the canonical bursty (and non-bursty) sequences used in
    training in the paper
*   `no_support_common`, `no_support_rare`, `non_support_zipfian` : These
    sequences enforce that the query class does not appear anywhere in the
    context, and are the sequences used for evaluating in-weights learning in
    the paper. They can consist entirely of common classes, rare classes, or be
    Zipf-distributed over all training classes.
*   `fewshot_common`, `fewshot_rare`, `fewshot_zipfian`, `fewshot_holdout` :
    These sequence are standard k-shot n-way fewshot sequences, and are used for
    evaluating in-context learning in the paper. They can exist of holdout
    classes, common classes, rare classes, or be Zipf-distributed over all
    training classes.
*   `mixed`: A mix of standard fewshot and iid randomly generated sequences.

Sequence types are specified in `config.data.train_seqs` and in
`config.eval_modes` (with an additional `eval_` prefix). You may specify a list
of eval modes, to evaluate the same learner on multiple sequence types.

See `experiment/experiment.py: _get_ds_seqs` and `datasets/data_generators.py:
SeqGenerator` for more details on settings, which are specified in
`config.data.seq_config`.


### Launch commands

These commands should be executed from the directory that you cloned the
repository into.

To run training:

```shell
$ python -m emergent_in_context_learning.experiment.experiment --config $PATH_TO_CONFIG --jaxline_mode train --logtostderr
# (save checkpoints using Ctrl+C)
```

To evaluate a trained model, override `config.restore_path` with the
subdirectory of `config.checkpoint_dir` containing the relevant checkpoint
(`$CKPT_DIR` below).

To evaluate on in-context learning (on holdout classes):

```shell
$ python -m emergent_in_context_learning.experiment.experiment --config $PATH_TO_CONFIG --logtostderr --config.one_off_evaluate --config.restore_path $CKPT_DIR --jaxline_mode eval_fewshot_holdout
```

To evaluate on in-weights learning (on trained classes):

```shell
$ python -m emergent_in_context_learning.experiment.experiment --config $PATH_TO_CONFIG --logtostderr --config.one_off_evaluate --config.restore_path $CKPT_DIR --jaxline_mode eval_no_support_zipfian
```

### Visualizing common-class query representations

The analysis script `analysis/common_context_umap.py` collects the transformer representation of the final (query) token for common classes across three evaluation conditions:

1. `eval_fewshot_common` sequences where the query class is labeled as `0` in the context.
2. `eval_fewshot_common` sequences where the query class is labeled as `1` in the context.
3. `eval_no_support_common` sequences where the query class does not appear in the context.

For each common class, the script gathers a configurable number of samples for each condition, projects the resulting representations to 2-D using UMAP (default) or PCA, and saves both the scatter plot and the underlying metadata (CSV + NPZ).

```shell
python -m emergent_in_context_learning.analysis.common_context_umap \
  --analysis_config experiment/configs/images_all_exemplars.py \
  --checkpoint $CKPT_DIR/checkpoint.dill \
  --output_dir /tmp/common_context_umap \
  --samples_per_class 32 \
  --projection_method umap  # or "pca"
```

`--analysis_config` should reference the same config that was used to train the
checkpoint (e.g., one of the files under `experiment/configs/`). You can supply
either a filesystem path such as
`experiment/configs/images_all_exemplars.py` or the corresponding Python module
path (`emergent_in_context_learning.experiment.configs.images_all_exemplars`).
Adjust `--checkpoint` to point to the directory or file containing
`checkpoint.dill`. Use `--projection_method pca` if you prefer PCA or you do not
have `umap-learn` installed; otherwise, keep the default UMAP setting and adjust
`--umap_neighbors` / `--umap_min_dist` as needed. The output directory will contain:

* `common_context_<method>.png`: Scatter plot colored by class and marked by context condition (`method` is `umap` or `pca`).
* `<method>_metadata.csv`: Coordinates and labels for each sample.
* `<method>_data.npz`: Raw representations, coordinates, class IDs, context labels, and the projection method.

If you already have a metadata NPZ file, you can regenerate the scatter plot without
loading a checkpoint:

```shell
python -m emergent_in_context_learning.analysis.common_context_umap \
  --metadata_npz /tmp/common_context_umap/umap_data.npz \
  --output_dir /tmp/common_context_umap
```

The script automatically infers the projection method from the NPZ (falling back to
`--projection_method` if necessary) and reuses the cached coordinates to produce a
fresh plot.
